# better-i3-reference
### [printable link](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jpreiss/better-i3-reference/blob/master/i3_reference.html)
a version of the i3 reference card with increased legibility.

main changes are:

- larger font size
- remove redundant "i3 modifier key" icon
- shorten some command descriptions

the goal is to make the reference legible when printed in portrait-mode and attached to the wall behind the monitor.
